# 🌌 **Hunter’s Interactive Solar System Portfolio**

An immersive, animated, and interactive **solar-system-themed developer portfolio**.  
Each planet represents a different section of my skills, projects, and experience.  
When clicked, planets zoom in or transition into new pages that reveal detailed information in a creative, gamified way.

This project demonstrates my skills in **HTML**, **CSS animations**, **JavaScript**, and creative UI/UX design.
